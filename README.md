In the natural world, flowers are not only beautiful but also diverse in shape, color, and fragrance. Each flower species has unique characteristics that make them easy to identify. For example, roses are known for their soft, layered petals and sweet scent, often used on romantic occasions. Daisies, with their sun-like shape and bright colors, symbolize cheerfulness and joy. Orchids stand out with their unique shapes and rich hues, often regarded as symbols of luxury and elegance. Additionally, the small, heart-shaped petals of violets can be found in gardens, evoking a sense of tranquility. Thanks to these distinct features, we can easily differentiate and appreciate the various flower species in nature.
